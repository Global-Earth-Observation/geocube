# Interfaces

Geocube is designed to be customizable and deployable in other environments. Several interfaces are declared and can be implemented to use external tools or services.

![Architecture](../images/GeocubeArchitecture.png)

All the interfaces are declared in the `interface` folder of the repository. After implementing an interface, it may be necessary to customize the `cmd/[...]/main.go` files to use the new interface.

If you implement a new interface, it will be very welcome to submit a [contribution](https://github.com/airbusgeo/geocube/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Storage

### Interface

The interface storage is used to read and write the images that are indexed in the Geocube. It must be accessible in reading by range-request and should be accessible in writing to support the consolidation (optimisation of the data).
The interface is available in `interface/storage` package.

To add a storage strategy, the following methods are to be implemented:

```golang
// Download file content as a slice of byte
Download(ctx context.Context, uri string, options ...Option) ([]byte, error)
// DownloadTo a local file
DownloadTo(ctx context.Context, source string, destination string, options ...Option) error
// Upload file content into remote file
Upload(ctx context.Context, uri string, data []byte, options ...Option) error
// UploadFile into remote file
UploadFile(ctx context.Context, uri string, data io.ReadCloser, options ...Option) error
// Delete file
Delete(ctx context.Context, uri string, options ...Option) error
// Exist checks if file exist
Exist(ctx context.Context, uri string) (bool, error)
// GetAttrs returns file attribute
GetAttrs(ctx context.Context, uri string) (Attrs, error)
```

The storage is infered from the prefix of the uri (protocol). The user can add an additionnal storage by implementing the interface and adding it in the `interface/storage/uri/` package.


### Currently supported storages

Currently, the geocube code supports three storage systems: AWS-S3, GCS and filesystem.

## Messaging

### Interface

The messaging interface is available here : `interface/messaging/`.
It is used to communicate between the ApiServer and the Consolidater, and it can be used as a metric by the Autoscaler to autoscale the ressources for the consolidater. It's a parameter of the constructor of the Service Class and it is configured in the following files: `cmd/apiserver/main.go` and `cmd/consolidater/main.go`.

### Pgqueue implementation

A messaging interface based on postgres is implemented using the [btubbs/pgq](https://github.com/btubbs/pgq) library: `interface/messaging/pgqueue`. This implementation has autoscaling capabilities.


### Pubsub implementation

Geocube supports PubSub (Google Cloud Platform) messaging broker : `interface/messaging/pubsub`.

Topics and subscriptions are to be created.

Topics:
- events
- events-failed
- consolidations
- consolidations-failed
- consolidations-worker (only if autoscaler is used)

Subscriptions:
- events
- consolidations
- consolidations-worker (only if autoscaler is used)

These actions could be performed manually or with terraform.
For more information, see: https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview.
You must have the Pub/Sub Admin role on your service account.

NB: Topics & Subscriptions must be created before running services.

A Pub/Sub emulator is available to use PubSub in a local system (with limited capacities).

Please follow the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator) to install and start the emulator.

## Database

### Interface

The database interface is available here : `interface/database/db.go`.
It is used by the ApiServer as a parameter of the constructor of the service and it is configured in the following file: `cmd/apiserver/main.go`.

### PostgreSQL Implementation

Geocube currently supports a Postgresql database with the PostGIS extension (`interface/database/pg/`).
Create a database and run the installation SQL script in order to create all tables, schemas and roles.
This script is available in Geocube code source in `interface/database/pg/create.sql`

```bash
$ psql -h <database_host> -d <database_name> -f interface/database/pg/create.sql
```

For ugrade, see [Update PostgreSQL database](#postgresql-database)

## Autoscaler

The autoscaler handles the scale-up or down of the consolidator service.
Itâ€™s an external service and does not have an interface. The current implementation, using Kubernetes, is available here : `interface/autoscaler/` and it is used in the Autoscaler service : `cmd/autoscaler/main.go`

## GRPC

Clients connect to the Geocube with a GRPC interface. This interface is automatically generated from the protobuf files in `api/v1/pb`.

From the Geocube side, protofiles are generated in the `internal/pb` folder. A GRPC server is then implemented in `internal/grpc` to interface the GRPC layer to the Geocube server.

From the client side, protofiles must be generated using the same files. It automatically creates a GRPC interface to connect to the Geocube.
See [Client Python](https://github.com/airbusgeo/geocube-client-python) or [Client Go](https://github.com/airbusgeo/geocube-client-go) for example.


Install `protoc`
``` shell
go get -u github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
```

Generate output from protofiles :
```bash
go generate generate.go
```
